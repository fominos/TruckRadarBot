# TruckRadarBot
The project involves the development of a Telegram bot utilizing the ConversationHandler for handling conversations. All information received from dispatchers is automatically transmitted to a Google Sheets table, while files are stored in Google Drive. Managers process the data in the table and add relevant files, which are then returned to the dispatchers.
